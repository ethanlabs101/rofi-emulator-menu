# ⭐ Favorites Menu & Compatibility

Retro-Fi allows you to save and launch your favorite games quickly through the favorites system.

## ✅ Supported Consoles

The following consoles fully support favorites functionality:
 - SNES
 - NES
 - Nintendo DS
 - GBA
 - GBC
 - GB
 - PlayStation 2
 - GameCube
 - Wii
 - Nintendo 3DS

> These systems are supported because the games are installed directly on your system, which allows Retro-Fi’s Bash scripts to properly parse launch commands and manage symlinks.

## ⚠️ Unsupported Consoles

- Favorites are currently unsupported for other systems (e.g., PlayStation 1, N64, Saturn, Dreamcast, Atari, etc.) because they rely on RetroArch cores or Flatpak-installed emulators.

- Until further development, the favorites function will not track or launch these systems reliably.

---

## 💡 Notes
 - Adding favorites for supported systems automatically creates symlinks in your favorites directory.
 - Recently played games follow the same restrictions.
 - Future updates may expand support to additional emulators and RetroArch cores.
