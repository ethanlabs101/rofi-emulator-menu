# Recently Played

Retro-Fi automatically tracks recently launched games and makes them accessible through the Recently Played menu.

## ✅ Compatibility

Most supported systems work correctly with the Recently Played feature.

Systems that are installed directly on the host system integrate seamlessly, as the launch commands can be parsed and logged properly.

## ⚠️ Limitations

Some systems that rely on RetroArch cores or Flatpak-based emulators may not register correctly in the Recently Played list.

Support may vary depending on how the emulator is installed and launched.
