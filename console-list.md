### ⚠️ Notes & Warnings

1. Experimental/Unsupported:  
   - *CD-i* and *Atari Jaguar-CD* are experimental and may not work reliably.  

2. Emulator Installation:  
   - Some emulators are installed via terminal package managers (apt, pacman, etc.).  
   - Others are installed via Flatpak (RetroFi-compatible commands included).  

3. RetroArch Cores:  
   - Some cores are installable directly in terminal via retroarch -L [core] commands.  
   - Others must be downloaded from [buildbot.libretro.com](https://buildbot.libretro.com/nightly/linux/x86_64/latest) — see the [Emulator Setup] page for step-by-step instructions per system.  

4. Xbox Support:  
   - Xbox emulation is limited and requires additional setup. Retro-Fi can launch it if you provide the necessary setup and BIOS, but no official links are provided.  

5. General Tip:  
   - Retro-Fi relies on a console → games folder structure. Please ensure your directories match the default setup for smooth operation.  
   - Favorites, saves, and box art functionality assume this structure.
